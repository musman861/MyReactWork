                    I am student of Software Engineering and during studies I started 
                    off my career as a Freelance Graphic Designer and over the last 2 
                    years have embraced the wonders of the ever-changing digital world.
                    I now specialized in User Interface and Experience Design, Pint 
                    Design, Web Design, Packaging Design, whilst also exploring some
                    new opportunities on Youtube; to both develop my personal brand
                    and help aspiring creatives to develop their skills. Iâ€™m a huge 
                    fan of technology and excited to where it will take us over the 
                    next 10 years. I just love to use Apple product, the reason is 
                    that I like slim, smart, clean and elegant things which can make
                    my life smooth. So, there we go, my life condensed into few 
                    lines.
